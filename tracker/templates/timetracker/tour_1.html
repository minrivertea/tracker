<h1>I hate trying to keep track of appointments on pieces of paper</h1>
<p>Agreed? This isn't another complicated time-tracking tool - we just want all of our appointments in one place, so we never miss another meeting, class, job or appointment again.</p> 

<p><a href="/tour/two/" class="button filled">And what is it you really, really love? &raquo;</a><a href="{% url anonymous_login %}" class="button">Looking for screenshots? Just try it out instead - it's free anyway!</a></p>
